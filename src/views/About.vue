    <h1>About Fanalyze</h1>
    <p>Created by Mark Kohrman in 2020, Fanalyze is a web app that started with the creator's dream: to crush his friends at fantasy football.  Although he didn't need much help, his passion for coding drove him to make the app.  Using Fanalyze, the fantasy football user can consolidate all of their teams on one website and compare projections.  It helps simplify gameday decisions for fantasy football players and helps them stay on top each fantasy team.</p>
